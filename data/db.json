      "body": "The coronavirus pandemic has reshaped the world. What began as a mysterious pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China, has spread—two to three people at a time—across 216 countries and territories.\nAs of March 19, 2021, the disease has infected more than 121,927,780 people, with 2,692,794 reported deaths. North and South America are the worst struck regions in terms of case count and fatalities, but Asia is not far behind, due mostly to surges in India. The global economy has plummeted, as containment and mitigation efforts continue to interrupt manufacturing, education, the financial sector, and many other walks of life.",

      "body": "Overall, cases in the United States are falling, but not quite as steeply as hoped. And spikes in several states have experts concerned another surge may be on the way.\nIn the past 14 days, deaths in the U.S. declined by 38 percent compared to the previous two-week period, and hospitalizations fell by 19 percent. Those are promising trends, says the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci. Yesterday, he told colleagues at a Senate hearing that the medical community is doing a good job completing between two and three million shots per day. If this continues, the country should remain ahead in the “race between our ability to vaccinate people and the emergence of variants,” Fauci said.",

      "body": "After damning accusations from federal health officials, AstraZeneca released results from the primary analysis of the completed U.S. phase three trial showing that its vaccine was 76 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. That is 3 percentage points lower than the results announced Monday, which were based on incomplete trial data that only extended until February 17.\n\nThe results were even better in adults 65 years and older; the vaccine had an efficacy of 85 percent. Most important, the vaccine was 100 percent effective at preventing severe COVID-19 and hospitalization and there were no reports of serious side effects, like those reported in Europe during the past month. AstraZeneca vaccinations were briefly halted in several European countries last week after a few people died from a rare blood clotting condition.\n\nAlthough the vaccine is not as effective as the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, it is safe and effective. The results are good news for AstraZeneca. In a highly unusual departure from what is usually a confidential process, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases revealed that AstraZeneca had been reprimanded for issuing an overly optimistic press release describing the results of its COVID-19 vaccine trials in the United States.",

      "body": "Wearing a crisp white shirt and a black bouffant curled in a flip, Aretha Franklin seemed pensive but confident as she walked into the legendary FAME Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in January 1967.\n\nFranklin, just 24 years old, proceeded to take control with exceptional poise. She had not yet become a musical and cultural icon. She had not yet become Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul.\n\nThat day, she was largely unknown and a mystery. The studio musicians were not sure what to think. The creative tension was as thick as the cigarette smoke. It’s hard to imagine now, but Franklin was desperate for a hit. \n\nShe had spent the previous six years recording a restrained kind of jazz at Columbia Records, without huge success. Now, at Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler wanted to bring out the “church” in Franklin. Musicians from FAME Studios had created a southern rhythm and blues sound that had produced a string of hits, including Wilson Pickett’s “Land of 1,000 Dances” and Percy Sledge’s classic “When a Man Loves a Woman.” ",
