            "body": "The coronavirus pandemic has reshaped the world. What began as a mysterious pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China, has spread—two to three people at a time—across 216 countries and territories.\nAs of March 19, 2021, the disease has infected more than 121,927,780 people, with 2,692,794 reported deaths. North and South America are the worst struck regions in terms of case count and fatalities, but Asia is not far behind, due mostly to surges in India. The global economy has plummeted, as containment and mitigation efforts continue to interrupt manufacturing, education, the financial sector, and many other walks of life.",

            "body": "Overall, cases in the United States are falling, but not quite as steeply as hoped. And spikes in several states have experts concerned another surge may be on the way.\nIn the past 14 days, deaths in the U.S. declined by 38 percent compared to the previous two-week period, and hospitalizations fell by 19 percent. Those are promising trends, says the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci. Yesterday, he told colleagues at a Senate hearing that the medical community is doing a good job completing between two and three million shots per day. If this continues, the country should remain ahead in the “race between our ability to vaccinate people and the emergence of variants,” Fauci said.",
